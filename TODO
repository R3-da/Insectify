Todo:
  ☐ fix image upload denied permission when choosing image from gallery and using "allow only this time" permission (it's probably uploading an array of bitmaps instead of one bitmap because it has the possibility to select multiple images)
  ☐ switch to simple time tracker app github actions test, build and deployement workflow
